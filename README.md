# SillyTavern Backport Import Character From URL Extension

Simple extension, which brings back the Import Character from URL button.

## Installation and Usage

### Installation

Use ST's inbuilt extension installer to install this extension.

### Usage

The added button functions the same way as the previous one. By default the backported button isn't added if the built-in one still exists, but you can change this behaviour via extension settings.
